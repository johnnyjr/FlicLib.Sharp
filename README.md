# FlicLib.Sharp
C# binders for using Flic with Xamarin

**NOTE:** In order for the iOS bindings to work you need to be on the alpha channel of Xamarin (see https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/embedded_frameworks/)

Example projects and a step-by-guide based on the tutorials on https://flic.io/partners/developers will be added shortly.
