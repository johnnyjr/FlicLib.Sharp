# FlicBind.iOS
C# bindings for using Flic with Xamarin.iOS

**NOTE:** In order for the iOS bindings to work you need to be on the alpha channel of Xamarin (see https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/embedded_frameworks/)

**NOTE 2:** You also need to add the fliclib.framework framework to your project (instructions here: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/embedded_frameworks/)
